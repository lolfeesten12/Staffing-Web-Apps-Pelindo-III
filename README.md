# Staffing Web Application for PT. Pelindo III Regional Bali Nusa Tenggara

The Personnel Application is an application that makes it easier for HRD and Senior Manager Units to manage personnel data. This application comes from a student client for a thesis with a case study of PT. Pelindo III. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in developing this application starting from business processes, database design and code implementation. 

This application is made from the problem of employee data that is not up-to-date, inaccurate which causes all employee data to be not well organized, The solution to these problems is to create an application that can manage employees of each unit at PT. Pelindo Bali.

## Development
The first step in application design is research, design thinking and business process design. Research is to learn from the business processes that will be designed and problem solving from these business processes. The business processes designed include Application Overview, Standard Operating Procedures, Context Diagrams, Data flow diagrams and Use case diagrams.

There are 7 (seven) roles in the application that have been created, including the Main Director Role, HRD Head Role, HRD Employee Role, Unit Director Role, Unit Manager Role, Sub Unit Head Role, and Sub Unit Employee Role.

### Tech Stack & Testing
Tech stack in application design which includes MySQL for databases, Laravel 8 Framework, Front-End HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 5), Backend PHP and Javascript. Business process design tools include Notion, Microsoft Visio and Visual Studio Code for code implementation.

The application has passed the testing using black-box system's functionalities testing with 3 testers and UAT (User Acceptance Testing) with 11 testers by distributing questionnaires, The scale used is Likert Summated Rating (LSR) with a very positive score

### Database
Database design is carried out on the MySQL application which is described in the form of PDM or Physical Data Model. PDM which was built as a guide in making Payroll Applications consisting of 28 entitas (table).
